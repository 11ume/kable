**Kable** ‚Äî Is a decentralized discovery service and load balancer system for Node.js
<br>

> An simple and pretty alternative to others centralized systems which involve complex architectures. 
<br>

**why?**

> Creating and maintaining a distributed services architectures is a very complex task, that involves things like load balancing, service discovery, health and status checking, fault tolerance, replication etc. The goal of **Kable** is to make some of these tasks easier to carry out. 
<br>

**This project is under active developement üî•**

<br>
<br>

**[Getting Started](https://github.com/11ume/kable/blob/master/docs/getting_started.md)** **In progress**

## Main features

* Automatic service discovery.
* Simply, easy to use and implement.
* Completely decentralized, no single point of failure.
* Each node maintains his own state, and knows in each moment the state of the nodes that are in their same subnet.
* Secured, encrypting sensitive information of each emitted datagram.
* Horizontally scalable, support node process replication.
* Intelligent node load balancing applying Round Bobin algorithm and first to be available.
* Agnostic, works in conjunction with any technology, Nest.js, Micro.js, Express.js, Apollo, MQTT, ZeroMQ, etc.
* Monitoring the status of external resources, through sentinel nodes.
* No need externals DNS servers, load balancers or centralized systems of discovery service.
* High performance because elimination of extra hop, everything a node might required is found in his memory, 
and is administered before it is requested.
* Master less architecture, all nodes are equal.
* Emits low amount of data. How?, not emitting redundant data and applying serialization via **[Message Pack](https://msgpack.org/)**.
* Implement Gossip protocol, **in review**.

#### kable is constituted by a series of modules, tools and special nodes called sentries nodes:
<br>
<br>

**[kable-core](https://github.com/11ume/kable-core)**
<br>

> Contains all modules and the main logic of Kable
<br>

**[kable-internals](https://github.com/11ume/kable-internals)**
<br>

> Is a little module to interact with some deep functionalities of kable
<br>

#### A serie of node sentries
<br>

> These are a series of special nodes, responsible for controlling with precision the status of some external service. You can create your own sentinel nodes.
